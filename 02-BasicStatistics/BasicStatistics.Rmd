# Univariate Analysis

In univariate analysis, we look at a single variable and describe 3 different things:

- Center
- Shape
- Spread

## Center

Helps explain where the middle of the data is. This can be measured in 3 main ways. 

### Mean

```{r}
grades <- c(78,79,80,81,82)

mean(grades)
```

### Median 

```{r}
median(grades)
```
### Mode

There isn't an easy way of doing this, so I created a function instead.

```{r}
getModes <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  tab <- tabulate(match(x, ux))
  ux[tab == max(tab)]
}


getModes(grades)
```

Since there is no value that occurs most frequently, they all show. Mode is rarely used.

## Shape 

For this, I am going to randomly generate 100 exam scores.

```{r}

grades <- rnorm(100,mean = 75, sd = 5 )
hist(grades)
```

You can mess with the `breaks = ` arguement to get different numbers of bins.

## Spread

Let's look at a different dataset. Starwars character heights.


```{r}
var(starwars$height)
```

What happened? We have nulls in our data, so we cannot calculate the variance until we tell the system to ignore null values

```{r}
var(starwars$height, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(starwars$height, na.rm = TRUE)
IQR(starwars$height, na.rm = TRUE)
range(starwars$height, na.rm = TRUE)
```


### Visualizing Spread

You can visualize the spread as well this with a boxplot. 

```{r}
boxplot(starwars$height)
```

You can see that a lot of them fall outside of the fences.

You could also visualize this with a histogram

```{r}
hist(starwars$height, breaks = "fd")
```


## Easier Way

To get most of the items of interest, you can simply use the `summary()` function. The standard deviation nor the variance is displayed, so you would still need those.

```{r}
summary(mtcars)

```

# Bivariate Analysis

When looking at 2 variables, we use correlation, scatterplots, and time series graphs.

## Correlation

```{r}
cor(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$hp)
```

These are strongly negatively correlated. We might say, horsepower has a inverse relationship with mpg, or mpg has a negative relationship with horsepower.

## Scatterplots

We can also visualize this relationship with a scatterplot.

```{r}
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg)
```

we can also make this look nicer with some labels

```{r}
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg,
     main = "Scatterplot of Horsepower and Miles Per Gallon",
     xlab = "Horsepower",
     ylab = "Miles Per Gallon")

```

## Time series graphs

Since the data we've seen thus far has been only cross section, let's bring in the data from the previous module. `Wealth1Percent.xlsx`


```{r}
Wealth1percent <- read_excel("../Data/Wealth1percent.xlsx",
                             col_types = c("date", "numeric","numeric"))
```

To add the trend line, we need to do something that we haven't discussed yet. Don't worry, I'll explain it in the next module.

```{r}
plot(Wealth1percent$quarter,Wealth1percent$Share, type = "l")
abline(lm(Share ~ quarter, data = Wealth1percent),lty = 2, col="red")
```



# More Visual Displays!


Here are some more ways to display data

## Data Tables


We can represent data in categorical fashion:

```{r}
table(starwars$hair_color)
```

Or quantitative

```{r}
bins <- seq(10,34,by = 2)

mpg <- cut(mtcars$mpg,bins)

table(mpg)
```

## Bar Charts



```{r}
n <- table(mtcars$gear)

barplot(n,xlab="Number of Gears")
```

## Stem and Leaf Plots

We can add `scale = 3` to make this line up properly

```{r}
stem(mtcars$hp, scale = 3)
```



# Fancier Output

Check out this fun stuff! Makes things look much cleaner.

## Table Output

Categorical

```{r}
hair <- table(starwars$hair_color)%>% 
  data.frame()

colnames(hair)[1] <- "Hair Color"

gt(hair)
```

Or quantitative

```{r}
bins <- seq(10,34,by = 2)

mpg <- cut(mtcars$mpg,bins)

table(mpg)%>%
  data.frame() %>% 
  gt()

```


## Summary Statistics

Using our classic `mtcars` dataset.

```{r}
mtcars%>% select(mpg, cyl,hp) %>% 
  tbl_summary(statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ c("{mean} ({sd})",
                                                    "{median} ({p25}, {p75})",
                                                    "{min}, {max}"),
                              all_categorical() ~ "{n} / {N} ({p}%)"),
              type = all_continuous() ~ "continuous2"
  )
```

## Histograms

### ggplot

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg))+ 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2,col = 'black', fill = 'darkblue', alpha = 0.75)+
  labs(title = 'Distribution of Miles Per Gallon', caption = "1974 Motor Trend US Magazine")+
  theme_bw()
```

### plot_ly

Since this is an interactive graph, it will not show up in a .pdf file, but it is great to look at in an .html document.

```{r}
plot_ly(x = ~mtcars$mpg, type = "histogram", alpha = 0.6) %>% 
  layout(title = 'Distribution of Miles Per Gallon',
         xaxis = list(title = 'Miles Per Gallon'),
         yaxis = list(title = 'Count'))
```

## Boxplots

I think the plotly version of a boxplot is superior since it is interactive.

```{r}
plot_ly(y = starwars$height, type = 'box', name = 'Height [cm]',text = starwars$name) %>% 
  layout(title = 'Distribution of Star Wars Character Heights')
```

## Correlation

```{r}
reduced <- mtcars %>% 
  select(mpg, hp, wt,qsec,disp,drat)

corrplot(cor(reduced),
         type = "lower",
         order = "hclust", 
         tl.col = "black",
         tl.srt = 45,
         addCoef.col = "black",
         diag = FALSE)
```


## Scatterplots

### ggplot

```{r}
ggplot(starwars,aes(height, mass))+
  geom_point(color = 'gray40')+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Relationship between Mass and Height of Star Wars Characters")
```


### plotly

```{r}
plot_ly(starwars, y = ~mass, x = ~height, type = 'scatter',text = ~name, mode = "markers")
```


## Trends


### ggplot

```{r}
ggplot(Wealth1percent, aes(quarter, Share))+
  geom_line(color = 'gray40',alpha = 0.75)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, color = 'darkblue', linetype = 'dashed')+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Share of Total Net Worth Held by the Top 1%",
       subtitle = 'from 1989-2022',
       x = "Date",
       y = "Share")
```

### plotly

To add the trend line, it gets quite tricky. 

```{r}
model <- lm(Share~quarter,Wealth1percent)
Trend <- predict(model,data = Wealth1percent$quarter)

plot_ly(Wealth1percent, x = ~quarter, y = ~Share, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines', name = "Share") %>% 
add_trace(y = ~Trend, name = 'Trend', mode = 'lines')


```
